    content: |-
      I am a Robotics masters student at University of Michigan. Previously I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science from Purdue University. 

      I am excited about exploratory robotics and leveraging autonomy to support science missions that go to the bottom of the ocean or into the depths of space. 

      Outside of classes I enjoy playing tenor saxophone in band and mentoring high school students on FIRST Robotics Teams.
